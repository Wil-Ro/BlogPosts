# AberCompSoc
This year I have become president of my university's compting society or "aberCompSoc". The society is mostly a body to provide a space for students to program and meet other passionate programmers to share and work on projects with. Additionally to this we are also a branch of the [BVS](https://www.bcs.org/) who we often run events with including hosting talks from professionals with links to the universities and also "Show and Tell" events where programmers can run short talks about the work they've been doing.

My hope for the society is to provide the spaces coding clubs used to provide for the coding community at my old schools, where students would just sit and have conversations around their passions whilst also working on their projects and making friends they could work together with and feel comfortable around.
