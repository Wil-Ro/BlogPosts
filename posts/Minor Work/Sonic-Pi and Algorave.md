# Sonic-Pi and Algorave
Sonic-Pi is a language build around live-coding and producing music algorithmically through code. Its based off Ruby and has a really nice twist that you see often in the live-coding community in that the code you write is constantly running and and being evaluated so as you write it the music being produced by it changes live.

I find Sonic-Pi a really nice way to relax with programming, it produces code that's inherently temporary and I find that really freeing. It can be easy to get burnt out with code and with Sonic-Pi, when that hits I just delete all my code and start again building something new. In another post I described it as "the programming equivalent of doodling on scrap paper".

I've written as larger post around my thoughts on algorave and live-coding in general [here](Livecoding.html) but it doesn't link any of my work so this page is here to represent the music I've created.

# My work
Most of my code written in sonic-pi is never saved, that's a part of its process. But I have one or two that I'm quite proud of saved. These are both on YouTube and can be found below, they're slow to start since I build up the code over-time so to give a better example of what they sound like these videos should automatically skip to good points.
