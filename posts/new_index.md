Hi, I'm Rosia

I'm a programmer, I'm slowly starting to think computer are less important now though. The world is getting pretty bad and we need to do something, I don't know what's right and most things I think, end up wrong. But I'm learning and slowly getting there. A few things I do know for sure are:

# The world isn't great right now
# Technology and change can help
# Computers are only a miniscule part of the solution
# Friends are important

I am programming, learning politics, understanding computers as a tool and trying to maintain a balanced social life.
