# An Obituary For My Living Mother

we all have the same amount of time here, we're all always learning. We all develop the same quantity of knowledge over time. Its just the matter of how we recognise and value that knowledge. Someone with severe disabilities is still learning just as much, they're just learning how to work in their own bodies in a world that doesnt teach them. You get put in their body, you'd struggle through for years without the knowledge they've developed.

At my Nanna and Taids (welsh grandparent)'s funerals, my mother gave talks, both each to the same tune of "my parents didnt do anything massively recognised or that changed the world, but they cared for their own, and that was massive". Or in a similar vein "they werent the most skilled at anything in particular, but they were handy, cared for us, repaired our cars and dedicated themselves to raising us". 

people talk abut this in a weird way. like, its deserving of recognition, but we have to give that there are greater people.

nah

we all develop as we go, at the same rate, my mum is an expert. All mothers are. The act of raising a child is an insane one, it destroys your life for years and leaves it permanently altered for the rest. You must leave it with such a different view on the world.

My mum has just as much expertise and skill as any engineer, professor or politician. We just dont value what shes put her expertise into.

mother fucking knows best

stop valuing tech barons, politicians and engineers. Value my mum, someone whos:

- scouts
- choir
- emotional support and advice throughout siblings+my troubles
- her parents
- my dad

we are all the best at living our lives.

even if this isnt true, the usefulness of an idea doesn't always correlate to its truth.
