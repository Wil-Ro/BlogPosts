# Computers Are Oil

[Start with some stuff about oil barons and the history of the oil industry]

My grandparents have a decent amount of money, a big house worth Â£1 million or so with a hot tub outside. They rent a property or two, they have more money than they really need.

They used to be so poor they would sometimes catch frogs and cook them. 

My grandad was a phone line engineer, he slowly moved into computing, found he enjoyed it and started doing it as a hobby too. Eventually his hobby became profitable and he started making digital timers for sports. He built the worlds first digital scoreboard, he used to show me the reams and reams of hand written assembly code he would manually insert into the chips for that thing. The stack of paper literally a foot and a half tall.

From that he became relatively well off, pretty quick, he soon ended up programming big systems for local councils and phone networks. He still maintained some of them for free in his retirement until only a few years ago.

I imagine he sees himself as someone who earnt his place, started and the bottom and worked his way up.

I love him, dearly and truly, but I see it differently.

He was lucky, he got into the right field at the right time, happened to enjoy it and have the brain for it at the right time. Because of that, he shot up.

Computing is oil.

We say "data is the new oil",  "ai is the new oil". No computers were always the new oil. We've been in that boom from the get go. Now its not even new, its been happening since Big Blue. Now They're are just oil. We're in the depths of the culture now. We're in the depths of the destruction mass compute requires.

I'd go as far as to say computing was worse than oil, oil required baseless claims to maintain, theres no skill to finding oil, no skill to selling or maintaining it. Not any skills that have a positive influence on the world anyway. Thats a hard lie to maintain.

computing is different, it requires a specific type of thinking, the engineers thought. There's your base, your argument. Your merit. Build an entire industry on it. Take oils lie, act as its proof and build entire valleys on it.

Merit is an odd thing, especially our modern version that focuses on "intelligence", engineering skill and logical thinking. It values one very specific thing, one thing that gets vaguer the more you look into it. [add more about merit and intelligence here]

Technology has done what it did to my Gramps to many many others, on a much bigger scale. Facebook, Netflix, Google, Amazon. They didnt intend to start what that started (outside of maybe amazon). They happened upon something useful. The people that run those companies argue on merit, they only hire the best of the best to maintain that air. They didnt get there on merit alone[does the alone bit belong here?], they got there on luck.

We need to stop calling them tech gurus, tech bros, tech ceos. We need to name them what they are. Tech Barons. Like the oil before them, they got where they are through luck more than anything else, and they know no better than the rest of us. They've manipulated and built an entire culture just to validate their existence. Unlike oil barons,  I don't think they even realise they're doing it, they just think its reality, truth, and they're just pushing for it.

These people shouldnt be idolised, they shouldn't be trusted. Call them barons, thats what they are. And whatever you do, dont trust them. Anyone who confidently knows how the world should work is lying. [Tech doesnt deserve optimism, its earnt skeptisism.](https://rosia.me:7777/starred/entry/373)
