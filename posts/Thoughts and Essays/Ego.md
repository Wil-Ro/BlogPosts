I know my ego is large

When Im not thinking I just lie to people and pretend I dont know what Im talking about

a friend pointed out to me, some saying, that pretending to be unknowing is just as bad as being egotistical, both are a complete disconnect from reality

this set me on a journey trying to work out a balance, I feel like it could take me years, I started a few months ago


False humility is just as bad as false hubris

FALSE HUMILITY CAN UNCOVER UNOTICED HUBRIS
