# Ego
A conversation on my thoughts around, and struggles with, ego.

# Programmers deeply and truly need to go outside.
We spend our whole careers with this ability to produce anything we think of (within our limited imagination) from the comfort of a desk. Along with this, we see work that mirrors ours covering the world, computing is the oil of the modern age. __(work this last sentence)__

From this alot of us develop an ego, a really bad one. From a personal perspective, this holds true even more so for children who grow up, like me, learning to program. Childhood is a search for identity and your own special talents and its very easy to think you're good at programming.

I should point out that I'm talking about myself here, ego and superiority complex is something a really struggle with. But this essay is also about a solid few other people too. All over the industry, I talk to people who are clearly the exact same as me but refuse to realise it. Unsurprisingly to some, this is especially common in the start-up scene.

From a personal perspective, this applies even more so if you grow up programming.

everyones work covers the world, ours is just new and focused on

I know my ego is large

When Im not thinking I just lie to people and pretend I dont know what Im talking about

a friend pointed out to me, some saying, that pretending to be unknowing is just as bad as being egotistical, both are a complete disconnect from reality

this set me on a journey trying to work out a balance, I feel like it could take me years, I started a few months ago


False humility is just as bad as false hubris

FALSE HUMILITY CAN UNCOVER UNOTICED HUBRIS
