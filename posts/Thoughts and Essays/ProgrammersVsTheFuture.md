# Programmers VS The Future
As programmers, change is so easy for us we always have visions of the future. In the last few decades this vision has soured, I want to explore that a bit here.

## At The Start
- Talk about historic views
- how it would feel to realise what computers mean


NOTE: maybe try find something from the 70s for this

## Now
- each for their own
- anarcho-capitalist
- silicone valley
- Oil produced oil barons, tech keeps striking its own oil, making modern barons

## Please dear god
Note: we dont want full automation, thats deluded and impossible, but theres many things we've already automated that should be benefitting all of us

a boss of mine once mentioned to me that we used to require 20 people for an acre, now its 20 acres per person

quotes to use:

The goal of the future is full unemployment, so we can play. That's why we have to destroy the present politico-economic system. - Arthur C Clark ("Los Angeles Free Press" Interview (April 25 1969, p. 43))

When your done, remember, libertarians are people who think they
sprung from their own asshole, the free market is a plot to
exploit your sorry ass, and all the real elite programmers are
[wobblies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Workers_of_the_World). - [Craig Brozefsky of Red Bean Software](https://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/inspiration.html)

maybe mention ego, how programmers as a field feel that they have the ability to shape the future, why we feel that way despite it barely relating to our work. how ego leads us to have bad ideas about the future

compare to oil barons a little? kiss a little?
oil barons come with ego, programmers feel even for earnt through work so different type of ego
