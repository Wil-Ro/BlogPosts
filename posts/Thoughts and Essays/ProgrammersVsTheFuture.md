# Programmers VS The Future
As programmers, change is so easy for us we always have visions of the future. In the last few decades this vision has soured, I want to explore that a bit here.

## At The Start
- Talk about historic views
- how it would feel to realise what computers mean


NOTE: maybe try find something from the 70s for this

## Now
- each for their own
- anarcho-capitalist
- silicone valley
- Oil produced oil barons, tech keeps striking its own oil, making modern barons

## Please dear god
Note: we dont want full automation, thats deluded and impossible, but theres many things we've already automated that should be benefitting all of us

a boss of mine once mentioned to me that we used to require 20 people for an acre, now its 20 acres per person

quotes to use:

The goal of the future is full unemployment, so we can play. That's why we have to destroy the present politico-economic system. - Arthur C Clark ("Los Angeles Free Press" Interview (April 25 1969, p. 43))

When your done, remember, libertarians are people who think they
sprung from their own asshole, the free market is a plot to
exploit your sorry ass, and all the real elite programmers are

### Understanding Ada
[here](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2015/12/untangling-the-tale-of-ada-lovelace/)

Ada was certainly aware of the future.
>On the way back, Ada taught some mathematics to the daughters of one of her mother’s friends. She continued by mail, noting that this could be “the commencement of ‘A Sentimental Mathematical Correspondence carried on for years between two ladies of rank’ to be hereafter published no doubt for the edification of mankind, or womankind”

She described her first paper as her first born and said it was
> “with a colouring & undercurrent (rather hinted at & suggested than definitely expressed) of large, general, & metaphysical views”, and said that “He [the publication] will make an excellent head (I hope) of a large family of brothers & sisters”.

Holy shit
> “It does not appear to me that cerebral matter need be more unmanageable to mathematicians than sidereal & planetary matter & movements; if they would but inspect it from the right point of view. __I hope to bequeath to the generations a Calculus of the Nervous System.__”

she understood that the computer would greatly improve science and the speed at which is progressed
> “We may consider the engine as the material and mechanical representative of analysis, and that our actual working powers in this department of human study will be enabled more effectually than heretofore to keep pace with our theoretical knowledge of its principles and laws, through the complete control which the engine gives us over the executive manipulation of algebraical and numerical symbols.”



She was aware of automation
>In Ada’s correspondence with Babbage, she showed interest in discrete mathematics, and wondered, for example, if the game of solitaire “admits of being put into a mathematical Formula, and solved”

An egotist
> “I believe myself to possess a most singular combination of qualities exactly fitted to make me pre-eminently a discoverer of the hidden realities of nature.” She talked of her ambition to do great things. She talked of her “insatiable & restless energy” which she believed she finally had found a purpose for.

> "Far be it from me, to disclaim the influence of ambition & fame. No living soul ever was more imbued with it than myself … but I certainly would not deceive myself or others by pretending it is other than a very important motive & ingredient in my character & nature.”

Her drive was mostly towards maths and god, just realising natural patterns
> my own uncompromising principle is to endeavour to love truth & God before fame & glory …”, while “Yours is to love truth & God … but to love fame, glory, honours, yet more.” 

Im sorry, unrelated but “High-Priestess of Babbage’s Engine”.

oh shit
>“I begin to understand Death; which is going on quietly & gradually every minute, & will never be a thing of one particular moment”

Huh babbage was forward thinking to an extent:
> Apparently he was fond of saying that he would gladly give up the remainder of his life if he could spend just 3 days 500 years in the future. 
Maybe I should take something from this and reflect it on myself, if I share more traits with the incompetent madman :/ Tho tbf they were both a bit insane

deeply upsetting that neither ada nor babbage cared about automating labour in any fashion other than to save money. Babbage saved money, ada didnt care and just wanted to understand the world which on one hand, based, but also fam come on


maybe mention ego, how programmers as a field feel that they have the ability to shape the future, why we feel that way despite it barely relating to our work. how ego leads us to have bad ideas about the future

compare to oil barons a little? kiss a little?
oil barons come with ego, programmers feel even for earnt through work so different type of ego


> Breathe lightly when needed, deeply when able. Treasure the air, and treasure each other, and work towards a world where we can provide for everyone the things that cannot be provided by a machine.
- Jacob Geller " Fixing My Brain with Automated Therapy"
