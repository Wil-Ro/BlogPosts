I worry that I annoy people, only when they arnt confident/they are anxious themselves do I show I like them because I no longer need to put myself out there anymore

poem about this:
drop the stereotypes, stop finding types of people that you can fit yourself into. Follow ideology, ideas of how you know is healthy to behave, what makes you comfortable, follow it
