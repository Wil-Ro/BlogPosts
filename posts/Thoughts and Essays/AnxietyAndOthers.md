# Anxiety and other people

I worry that I annoy people, only when they arnt confident/they are anxious themselves do I show I like them because I no longer need to put myself out there anymore


# Unrelated
poem about this:
drop the stereotypes, stop finding types of people that you can fit yourself into. Follow ideology, ideas of how you know is healthy to behave, what makes you comfortable, follow it


# Sometimes
Im following a load of different unrelated thoughts for half an hour or so, then I leave it and find myself feeling like Im gonna cry, and I dont know why or what thought caused it. What does that mean? I was thinking abut harry tennant, having a claim of mine proved correct at work today and was listening to cosmonaughts by fiona apple. And my family, I was thinking about them, Im at home with them rn and I just really really love them
