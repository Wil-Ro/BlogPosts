# Kindness
I used to value that, alot. Really alot, to the point I convinced myself the best way to live was to convince your self you'd been sent to earth to sacrifice yourself for everyone else.

I dont do that anymore, its definitely healthier. But I've left myself with an emptyness, I think. I don't value kindness anymore, kindness is the easy one, I did it for most of my teenage years and before. What took me time to learn was much harder, saying no, doing whats good for me, valuing myself.

But I've gone too far, I read the words of [An](https://ninecoffees.blog/on-the-eyes/)[gels](https://ninecoffees.blog/lets-do-laundry-together-goodbye-cohost/) and I realised I've lost it. 

I see my angel friends who still hold these values and I pity them. "They destroy their lives for one or two ungreatful few", but thats not true at all.

"Be as kind as you can bare to be" might be a good balance, kind until you reach a point just before it hurts you

I want to help, I want to stop environmental collapse. I know alot of people worry about this stuff but find themselves feeling like they cant do anything or that they shouldnt.

I know I could or that its possible

but I need to realise, it is but through a community effort

Im skipping the community and just going straight to it

I need to stop thinking about that, start finding friends I agree with and value (Hi Bob!)

Only once Im in a true community can that group do anything, as long as its willing to and the consensus says its worth doing
