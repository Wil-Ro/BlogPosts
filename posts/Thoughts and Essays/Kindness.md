# Kindness
A short post on my experiences around kindness and how my views on it have changed and grown, not necessarily for the better, over time.

## P1 - The Past
I grew up with an innate understanding of the value of kindness. My parents praised me when I was nice and I was generally a pretty quiet and kind person. Eventually, this became something I was known for and when that happens, you take it in and it becomes a core part of your identity. Its comforting to have something to tie your identity to, and for me a big part of that was kindness.

I did a lot of my growing in 6th form. During that time I found myself learning about ideology and theory, and to put this into practise i convinced myself that what I did, I did because I held a sound and reasoned world view. This obviously wasn't true, I'd been kind for a very long time, but it was a way to fit myself into what I was learning. I implemented this to a somewhat unhealthy extent, I remember a short few months where I convinced myself to live as if "I [was] a being, sent here with a single purpose: to sacrifice myself for others. If I finish life having improved others worlds, I'll have done well, no matter how I come out of it". I knew this obviously wasn't true, but the moral behind it held strong to me. Looking at it now, and I was aware of this then too, this lacked any sort of care for myself. At the time I was fine with this, in fact I was proud of it. In reality it was likely a symptom of my inability to say no to people; I convinced myself it was a good thing, something I chose to do. However, doing this got me burnt, obviously.

In 6th form I found myself in two different relationships As a trans person, relationships pre-transition are odd; am I enjoying this out of love, or because having a boyfriend is a rare shred of the stereotypical feminine experience? Either way, these relationships weren't for me and I had to leave. However, not wanting to hurt my partners, and being too scared to tell them, I just simply did not. I stayed in them. In the case of the first one, for over a year.

"I'm giving my all, my body and soul to make this persons life a positive one, whether mine is or not, and that's a good thing."

This is obviously an awful idea, and mostly a bad excuse for cowardice. The first of these relationships ended in a paranoid-breakdown on both sides (to shorten a wild story), the second only ended when a friend forced me out of it.

Outside of relationships, this mindset had me hosting the vented problems of every person in my teen friend group, spending my evening with someone every night consecutively for six months just to stop them from entering anxious vomiting fits and eventually bursting out in a drunk crying fit in front of two friends, shouting about how I wasn't human, was an angelic being and I was failing to maintain my purpose (all obviously very healthy and normal).

After 6th form, I'd learnt this was not a good mindset. However, still a coward, I hit the same issues. I had a gap-year, during which time I was in a relationship with a man who would regularly consider suicide, throw fits if I spoke to someone without him and, as I later found out, sometimes thought he was a dog reincarnated as a human (????). Probably the most extreme example of me trying to give my life to caring for someone who I convinced myself both needed and deserved it.

## P2 - The Present
I entered university somewhat soured by these experiences. I found myself desperate not to make friends with people who I'd fall into this trap with and subsequently ended up being very cold and pretty mean to some very vulnerable people.

My view on kindness had changed a lot. When I saw someone being kind, or being praised for their kindness, my first though was always "being kind is the easy part, the hard part is learning to care for yourself". I would come across genuinely loving and caring people, and almost feel sorry for them, thinking "wow, this person is so lovely, its such a shame they're being taken advantage of by their partners".

I had some really shallow, unpleasant thoughts about people during this first year. I felt an emptiness from this, knew what I was saying was cruel, but would tell myself it was necessary to protect myself. "I'll slowly find a balance for one day, but for now, this is the deal."

I remember having a conversation with a friend, someone I truly respected, where they said that in their view, a core part of living well was helping others, that their favourite trait of themselves was their caring nature. "Cute", I thought to myself.

I'd help a friend, listen to their problems and views and all I could think was "How cliche, this is the 3rd time I've heard this exact line, can you have a more original view on your sadness". I'd think "I'm happy to help this once, but if they come to me more than 3 or so times, I'll have to cut them off, I can't risk this becoming the standard".

But while these thoughts were happening, I couldn't help but feel I'd soured. I used to *want* to help people, now, even if I did externally help people, and was known to be nice, in my head I thought nothing but the opposite. I'd turned cruel almost. I could excuse it as self-protection while I grew, but I needed to do that growing for that to be valid.

## P3 - The Future
My mind still sat there until rather recently. A few small experiences over time built up to lead me to slowly want to change. For one, I saw my giving friends again and realised, they were happy and loved. I saw friends I'd offered support to grow and heal! I realised two of my closest and oldest friends, who I hold an unending respect for and who I see as whole, unique souls who teach me something new whenever I see them, had become this way through that support I'd offered them years ago, anywhere from in primary school to the very 6th form years I complained about earlier!

I realised those friendships and strengths come from fighting through and sticking with each other.

I read the words of [An](https://ninecoffees.blog/on-the-eyes/)[gels](https://ninecoffees.blog/lets-do-laundry-together-goodbye-cohost/) and I saw my childhood self, valued, not exploited. I respected them. I became open to their world view, even if I hadn't found a balance I felt safe to hold yet.

This week I found a new favourite blog post. [Just enough news](https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/just-enough-news). The author glides by the phrase

"Be as kind as you can bare to be"

I wonder if this is a good balance, be as kind as you can, including to yourself. When it starts to hurt, stop, tell the people around you. You can do both. My dithered grey matter lead me though hell, as for a lot of people, I needed to learn to blend the black and white.

Im still getting there, balancing my needs with others, but it'll happen, gimme another few years.

# Notes

## Kindness
I used to value that, alot. Really alot, to the point I convinced myself the best way to live was to convince your self you'd been sent to earth to sacrifice yourself for everyone else.

I dont do that anymore, its definitely healthier. But I've left myself with an emptyness, I think. I don't value kindness anymore, kindness is the easy one, I did it for most of my teenage years and before. What took me time to learn was much harder, saying no, doing whats good for me, valuing myself.

But I've gone too far, I read the words of [An](https://ninecoffees.blog/on-the-eyes/)[gels](https://ninecoffees.blog/lets-do-laundry-together-goodbye-cohost/) and I realised I've lost it. 

I see my angel friends who still hold these values and I pity them. "They destroy their lives for one or two ungreatful few", but thats not true at all.

"Be as kind as you can bare to be" might be a good balance, kind until you reach a point just before it hurts you

I want to help, I want to stop environmental collapse. I know alot of people worry about this stuff but find themselves feeling like they cant do anything or that they shouldnt.

I know I could or that its possible

but I need to realise, it is but through a community effort

Im skipping the community and just going straight to it

I need to stop thinking about that, start finding friends I agree with and value (Hi Bob!)

Only once Im in a true community can that group do anything, as long as its willing to and the consensus says its worth doing

## Other
Deescalate all conflict that isn’t with the enemy.

Note to add this to the kindness essay when you have time
[this same line of thinking applies to violence as well… do not ever engage in violence first. however, if you are attacked, fight back. protect yourself and those you care about from physical and mental harm always.](https://elenafortune.com/manifesto)
