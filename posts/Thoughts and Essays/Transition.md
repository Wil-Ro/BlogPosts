# An Auto-Biography Of My Transition
## Intro
This will be kind of a bit blunt and some weird stuff will happen. Not hiding anything. Be wary of accuracy and old memories, we think in narratives

## Before
Primary school
transformation in films
idols e.g. Eva?
genie

## Just Before
cat hoodie
Femboy/Trap
Twitter
Traa
Junko
Catfishing/voice attempts at the fleece


## Early Days
Junko
Zach
Telling parents
Mermaids
Clothes
Window Climbing
Doubts about reddit
Art
Talking to school, people crying at a happy thing
gender therapist
euphoria, how it feels, how I nolonger have it

## Thoughts arriving
Coming and going, during coming and going was, video game characters
Fondness for the start
Doubts about all of it
Femininity + Anime Girls
Who do I want to be?
is this attention seeking?
hard to emphasis how often I would think about it sometimes - then sometimes wouldnt for a few days and would worry its fake


## The Slow Burn
friends she/her'ing me without me asking, they them pissed me off
daisy + hugboxing
Mum Crying, going back in the closet
Transvestism
Doubts for a long time
Being out to friends, disliked pronouns, into the closet with you!
Trans friends
Mermaids
The want to run away/the want for new friends/will wood
Is it masculine or just human? oh shit femininity isnt real
Danced with medication - 0 guidance to the process of medical transition

## End Of The Slow Burn
4chan
Tipping point thoughts
Hormones
Gap year decision

## Action / Gap Year
Swan, voice training on days off when no one is home
Clothing, makeup, fashion - clothing and the environment
Hormones, NHS, Fertility Preservation (adoption? changing views on it later in life?), deciding if it was a good idea, regret and such? 

Small-world, Cole/Marvin/Devon, 

SBS - transvestism at work
Voice training clicking
HRT lies for a month or so
GenderGP

Youtubers and The transgender issue, Pride (does this go in this section?)


## University
Holyshit I pass (I might have already thought this before?) - womens bathroom
what percentage of people so i pass to
Desperation to keep passing
Hiding from friends, lying, coming out to a few close people, hiding from other trans people!
Voice sticking/habituating
Becoming myself, who I am, did I already have this in mind before uni or did it work out here?
Womens spaces
helping athena
representing all trans people
being there for baby transes, telling them what I would have wanted to know myself

# Additional notes to make
thoughts on innocence <- freudian shit
never really experiencing hate outside of odd looks. Even none from bad friends apart from one or two vague comments about fantasising about being a princess. Then at work its now regular but indirect and innocent
