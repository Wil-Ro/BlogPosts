# Welcome!
I'm Rosia Evans, this is my site where I log my work for myself and for me to show to others.

This site is generated procedurally from markdown though C++ code I've written and hosted using [lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net/) on an old laptop through my router. You can find the code for it [here](https://github.com/Wil-Ro/Blog) and a more indepth talk about it [here](/ThisSite.html).

## Who I am

<img src="profile.jpeg" alt="image of me" style="width:30%;">

I'm a software engineering student currently studying at a small university in wales whilst teaching myself robotics
and exploring my own interests on the side including:

- Exploring how we can use computers in environmentally sustainable ways
- Exploring how robotics can work in real world environments
- Learning to create low power programs and robotics
- Working with environmental groups for conservation and political change
- Following the computing scene as a whole

Most of my interests lie in low-power computing, experimenting with how
computers can work in an environmentally friendly manner. The environment is something I think
about a lot and finding overlaps between it and my interests in computing has lead me to some really
interesting communities.

I feel that computers and automation really could help produce a sustainable
world where people can easily afford the bare minimum and find themselves comfortable and happy.
