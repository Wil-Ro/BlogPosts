# Welcome!

This is my site where I log my work for myself and for me to show to others.

>This site is generated procedurally from markdown though C++ code I've written. It's hosted using [lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net/) on an old laptop through my router. You can find the code for it [here](https://ithub.com/Wil-Ro/Blog) and a more in-depth talk about why I did that [here](/ThisSite.html).

## Who I am

I'm Rosia Evans, I'm a software engineering student currently studying at a small university in wales whilst teaching myself robotics
and exploring my own interests on the side.

Most of my interests lie in low-power computing, experimenting with how
computers can work in an environmentally friendly manner. The environment is something I think
about a lot and finding overlaps between it and my interests in computing has lead me to some really
interesting communities. My physical work involves:

- Exploring how we can use computers in environmentally sustainable ways [see here](permacomputing.html)
- Exploring how robotics can work in real world environments [see here](SailBot.html)
- Learning to create low power programs and robotics [see here](ThisSite.html)
- Working with environmental groups for conservation and political change
- Following the computing scene as a whole

I feel that computers and automation really could help produce a sustainable
world where people can easily afford the bare minimum and find themselves comfortable and happy.

If you want an outline of my work, these are some things I'm really proud of:
- [Skipton Building Society](/SBSWork.html)
- [AberCompSoc](/aberCompSoc.html)
- [AardvarkXR](/Aardvark.html)
