# Welcome!
I'm Rosia Evans, this is my site where I log my work for myself and for me to show to others.

This site is generated procedurally from markdown though C++ code I've written and hosted using [lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net/) on an old laptop through my router. You can find the code for it [here](https://github.com/Wil-Ro/Blog) and a more indepth talk about it on [this blog post](/ThisSite.html).

I'm currently studying at a small university in wales where I'm doing a BEng in software engineering whilst working on robotics and exploring my own interests on the side through various societies and personal projects.

Nowadays my interests lie mostly in low-power computing and electronics, experimenting with how computers can work in a more environmentally friendly manner. I find the environment is something I think about a lot and finding overlaps between it and my interests in computing has lead me to some really intersting communities.

On the side of this I also enjoy using code to create music through programming using [Sonic-Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) and just creating programs in general with friends and colleagues. Most of my work can either be found in blog-posts here or on my [github](https://github.com/Wil-Ro).

I've previously had interests in VR and XR and UI design, spending a lot of my secondary school years experimenting with both concepts so both websites also have a few probjects relating to those concepts.

If you want a basic outline of my work, here are a few interesting projects:

- [My Work running AberCompSoc](/aberComSoc.html)
- [AardvarkXR](/Aardvark.html)

To see all of my work, check the navbox to the side.
