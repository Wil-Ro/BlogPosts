# Welcome!

This is my site where I log my work for myself and for me to show to others.

>This site is generated procedurally from markdown though C++ code I've written. It's hosted using [lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net/) on an old laptop through my router. You can find the code for it [here](https://github.com/Wil-Ro/Blog) and a more in-depth talk about why I did that [here](/ThisSite.html).

## Who I am

I'm Rosia Evans, I'm a programmer currently studying at a small university in Wales whilst teaching myself to create robots and exploring how we can use them to create a sustainable way for us to live beyond food scarcity.

Most of my interests lie in using robotics and computers in farming and the creation of code that uses as little energy as possible, exploring how they could help produce more food in a sustainable manner. I feel that computers and automation really could help produce a green
world where people can easily afford the bare minimum and find themselves comfortable and happy.

My physical work involves:

- Learning how robotics can work in [real world environments](SailBot.html)
- Experimenting with how we can use computers in [environmentally sustainable] (Permacomputing.html) ways,
- Teaching myself to create [low-power/high efficiency programs](ThisSite.html) and robotics,
- Exploring ideas behind farming automation and how we can produce more food whilst keeping our methods sustainable, becoming an active member of communities such as [GOAT](https://goatech.org/) and [TwistedFields](https://community.twistedfields.com/t/welcome-to-the-twisted-fields-community-forum/7),

I've been programming for most of my life. My main language is C++, but I also have multiple years of experience in C#, Python and Java and some loose experience in Typescript and C.

If you want an outline of my work, these are some things I'm really proud of:
