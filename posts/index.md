Hi, I'm Rosia

I'm a student into robotics, politics and environmentalism. I spend my time programming, repairing things and trying to balance my overly active social life along with it.
The world stresses me out quite a bit and I want to help make it better, so I spend a lot of my time thinking about politics. Most of my thoughts turn out to be wrong but I'm slowly getting there.

I'm learning to value simplicity, community and things outside of computers and infinite growth.
