Over the last few months I've been slowly building up designs in my head and on paper for a future project, this page is for me to store some of those to show to friends.

The first problem is the moisture sensor, this is kind of long and I could imagine it blocking things or being hit against things so it needs to be able to be tucked away. This would be a moving part which isn't super ideal, main problems are:
- Mud debris getting in the mechanism
- Becoming overly complex or delicate
- Water-proofing

My initial solutions are below, but it feels like it would be worth looking into finding a solution that doesn't need to move at all, if the tool was attached to an arm then it could be something only gets in the way at a certain rotation and we'd only use that rotation when we're using the tool, that feels like a stretch though.
