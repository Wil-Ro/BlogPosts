# Green Opal

In Febuary of 2023 I went to [fosdem](https://fosdem.org/2025/). There I met a lot of really cool people and got into a conversation with some of them about [godot](https://godotengine.org/) and about my work with vr game development. The people I was talking to about this had a small game development team that took part in gamejams regularly and wanted to try make their own full game. They invited me to join their team, named Green Opal, and work on their games with them! Two years on and I've ended up joining a really nice friend group who make some really neat games and are generally just really cool people!

[Here's our website](https://green-opal.studio/)

Our main focus is a game called Toad Towers about frog architects building skyscrapers. Its early days but its fun so far :)
