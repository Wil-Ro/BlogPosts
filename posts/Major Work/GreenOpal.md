I've been going to [fosdem](https://fosdem.org/2025/) most years since 2022. On my first year there I made some friends who I now make games with.

We call our group Green-Opal Studio, (we got this neat little website [here](https://green-opal.studio/)). Our main focus at the moment is on a small game titled Toad Towers, a deck-builder game where you play as a frog architect building sky-scrapers. Its in its early days but working on it has been really fun!

As well as this, the group takes part in the [Ludum Dare](https://ludumdare.com/) game jams pretty regularly. I took part 
in my first one October of this year, we made a game about a raccoon re-greening a scrap yard and building robots out of junk. It had hand-painted sprites, an adaptive sound track that changed as the scrap yard got cleaner and some really neat little animations that I set up.

This video shows some of its gameplay nearing the end of the jam, a few bug fixes were made a bit later on too.

Generally, I don't massively enjoy game development but I've found that with this group I get a lot out of it and I'm enjoying visiting it on and off as a break from my other work.
