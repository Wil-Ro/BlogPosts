# Album Covers
I think from now on all my programs will have album covers. A small square ratio image representing the program. Its a nice way to get across my intentions with the program, what vibes, uses and ideologies it represents. Plus, it gives me an excuse to touch grass and go outside and photograph things or do art, both of which I need to do more of.
