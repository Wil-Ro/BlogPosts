# Clear Line Docs
These are notes on important things to help keep my thinking in a logical, clear line. Normally these notes will revolve around politics and ideas around how life should be lived. Expect my thoughts on Ego, Automation, Political Change, Gender and anything else I feel is important. The format generally follows a topic and then points relating to that topic I want to be able to confidently hold.

## Transgenderism is good
### Anyone anti-trans is likely also bigoted in other manners

[James Finn via Medium - LGB is a hate group](https://medium.com/james-finn/dont-be-fooled-by-the-lgb-alliance-7f0838f5b245)

### Gender is a social construct

I can argue this on my own without external backup but something to send people if I don't have time or they arn't worth the effort. Prioritize in person explanation though.

### Transgenderism has been around since we've had the concept of gender roles
- the roman emperor elagabalus tried to find a doctor who would give him a vagina
- Even Bochan, Kalonymus ben Kalonymus, a jewish poem where the writer expresses their deep desires to be a woman
- the priests of Inanna took women's names and dressed in women's clothing [trans writings from From the cuneiform translations interpreted in

## Climate change is a genuine issue and it needs large scale action from world governments immediately
### We're seeing the effects of climate change right now

[The Guardian - Large-scale and intense wildfires carrying smoke across northern hemisphere](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/23/large-scale-and-intense-wildfires-carrying-smoke-across-northern-hemisphere)


[The Guardian - Firefighters try to save Jasper as fast-moving wildfire hits Canadian resort town](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/25/jasper-alberta-canada-wildfire) --- [Mastodon thread of photos from same wild fires](https://mastodon.social/@Snowshadow/112847636621240368)

## UBI has benefits and is doable
### What is UBI spent on?

[OpenResearch - Key Findings: Spending](https://www.openresearchlab.org/findings/key-findings-spending) (alternatively, this is also evidence that UBI is good for the economy as it shows money given is spent)

## Capitalism needs altering, if not replacing
### Capitalism isn't the default
Trade has existed for a very long time but generally until the industrial revolution in the 17-1800s a lot of people basically didn't use money for anything other than large acts. They'd use common land and their gardens to graze cows harvest wood for fires and grow food. Only during [enclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure) did people get forced out of this and made reliant on money and work. 

A good book for this would be Jeanette Wintersons essay "A loom with a view". A whole book about the idea of capitalism being the default is Mark Fishers "Capitalist Realism"
