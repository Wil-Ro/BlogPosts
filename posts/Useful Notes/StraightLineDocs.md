# Straight Line Docs
These are notes on important things to help keep my thinking in a logical, straight line. Normally these notes will revolve around politics and ideas around how life should be lived. Expect my thoughts on Ego, Automation, Political Change, Gender and anything else I feel is important.

## Points I want to be able to confidently believe

### Transgenderism is good
#### Anyone anti-trans is likely also bigoted in other manners

[James Finn via Medium - LGB is a hate group](https://medium.com/james-finn/dont-be-fooled-by-the-lgb-alliance-7f0838f5b245)

#### Gender is a social construct

I can argue this on my own without external backup but something to send people if I don't have time or they arn't worth the effort. Prioritize in person explanation though.

### Climate change
#### We're seeing the effects of climate change right now

[The Guardian - Large-scale and intense wildfires carrying smoke across northern hemisphere](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/23/large-scale-and-intense-wildfires-carrying-smoke-across-northern-hemisphere)

### UBI has benefits and is doable
#### What is UBI spent on?

[OpenResearch - Key Findings: Spending](https://www.openresearchlab.org/findings/key-findings-spending) (alternatively, this is also evidence that UBI is good for the economy as it shows money given is spent)
