# UseNet Posts

Usenet posts are one of my favourite forms of internet content, they age amazingly since they only stay on the internet for as long as someone is keeping them archived. They only stay archived while some random programmer still finds they hold place in their mind. They only stay in that persons mind while they're funny, unique or in some other way interesting.

I have a few posts I really like and I don't want to lose them so I've started holding them here, mostly just for myself. If you have another you've found that you think I'd enjoy, email me and I'll add it :)

## [The Benefits Of Using The Scheme Configurable Window Manager](usenet_the_benefits_of_using_scwm.txt)
[Found listed as inspiration for the ratpoison window manager](https://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/)

A post I got completely obsessed with for a few weeks back in March of 2024, it describes how you can avoid drug addiction through the use of a good window manager. It also ends with an amazing little rant that really captures a certain breed of programmer that I love.

## [Advanced Missile Garbage Collection](usenet_missile.txt)
[Found in a microsoft blogpost](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180228-00/?p=98125)

A description of an advanced form of garbage collection used in military equipment. Funny but also obvious when you think about it.

## [The Usenet Cookbook](https://www.ty-penguin.org.uk/~auj/Usenet.Cookbook/)
Not deeply related but a useful list of interesting recipes a friend of a friend maintains. Also see [his smaller list](https://www.ty-penguin.org.uk/~auj/Usenet.Cookbook/).
