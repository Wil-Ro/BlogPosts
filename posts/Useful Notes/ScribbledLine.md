This is my scribbled line, its a collection of things I find interesting or want to remember. Here you can find a good summary of my world views in the writings I find important and things I just think are neat.

## Important things

### Writing that permanently altered me
- [Kae tempest - A book of traps and lessons](traps-and-lessons/) this poetry is genuinely probably the biggest driver behind a lot of my world views. Whole thing should be experienced in one session, somewhere outdoors alone and dark, whether that's sat outside a pub at night with a drink or in a forest.
- [silly, goofy article about football in the future](https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football)

### Healthy conversation, thought and debate
- [Cory Dransfeldt - Just Enough News](https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/just-enough-news)
- [xxiivv - how to have healthy discorse](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/discourse.html)

### The value of other cultures (especially non-scientific, stereotypically "primitive" cultures)
- [Study notes on "Against his-story, Against Leviathan!"](http://noblesavagery.blogspot.com/2007/03/fredy-perlmans-against-his-story.html) (I haven't read these notes, only the actual book but I imagine it gets the point across). This is possibly the strongest narrative for properly emotionally integrating this point into your world-view, though the book itself is incredibly biased and a bit unhinged. Would recommend chapter 23 specifically.
- [Twitter thread on african architecture](https://x.com/Vincredible__/status/1167748981188902914)

### Anti-Growth, Small-Web, Small-Tech
- [Factorio hate-post](https://reincantamentox.substack.com/p/drop-13-divine-automation)
- [The reckless, infinite scope of web browsers](https://drewdevault.com/2020/03/18/Reckless-limitless-scope.html)
- [Fucking webmaster](https://justinjackson.ca/webmaster/)

### The value of community
- [Transcender manifesto](https://digital-anthropology.me/2019/03/13/a-transcender-manifesto-for-a-world-beyond-capitalism-a-seed/)
- [The sky is falling, we've got this](https://margaretkilljoy.substack.com/p/the-sky-is-falling-weve-got-this)

### The merits of open source
- [Predator drones run linux](https://j3s.sh/thought/drones-run-linux-free-software-isnt-enough.html)
- [The sustainability of the commons](https://ploum.net/2024-07-01-opensource_sustainability.html)
- [How to kill an decentralised network](https://rosia.me:7777/feed/38/entry/1390), a post about how companies purposefully kill off foss software
