This is my scribbled line, its a collection of things I find interesting or want to remember. Here you can find a good summary of my world views in the writings I find important and things I just think are neat.

## Important things

### Writing that permanently altered me
- [Kae tempest - A book of traps and lessons](traps-and-lessons/) this poetry is genuinely probably the biggest driver behind a lot of my world views. Whole thing should be experienced in one session, somewhere outdoors alone and dark, whether that's sat outside a pub at night with a drink or in a forest.
- [silly, goofy article about football in the future](https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football) showed me that you should try to find wonder and whimsy in the everyday and the mundane, and that those things are vital to existing as a human.
- [Contrapoints](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RTRT794IQBg) helped me realise how I want to experience love and helped me learn to respect myself, though nowadays I've realised they're a pretty flawed person sometimes
- [CJt](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UvYcunuF3Eo)[heX](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GZg_36utl2w) helped me work out how to exist in the moment and just actually feel things (the first of the two linked videos, second is a better summary but came out much later)
- [Leon Rosselson](leon-rosselson/) showed me that its okay for life to be messy and imperfect, that we don't need a system to solve every problem and helped me understand what people say when they mean property is theft. He's a bit too radical for me sometimes but that's fine. He's 93 now and only has 3000 or so listeners on spotify. I wish more people knew about his music, there's a lot you can take from it that applies to modern politics.

### Healthy conversation, thought and debate
- [Cory Dransfeldt - Just Enough News](https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/just-enough-news)
- [xxiivv - how to have healthy discorse](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/discourse.html)

### The value of other cultures (especially non-scientific, stereotypically "primitive" cultures)
- [Against his-story, Against Leviathan!](http://noblesavagery.blogspot.com/2007/03/fredy-perlmans-against-his-story.html) This is possibly the strongest narrative for properly emotionally integrating this point into your world-view, though the book itself is incredibly biased and a bit unhinged. Would recommend chapter 1 or 23 specifically, 23 especially.
- [Twitter thread on african architecture](https://x.com/Vincredible__/status/1167748981188902914)

### Anti-Growth, Small-Web, Small-Tech
- [Factorio hate-post](https://reincantamentox.substack.com/p/drop-13-divine-automation)
- [The reckless, infinite scope of web browsers](https://drewdevault.com/2020/03/18/Reckless-limitless-scope.html)
- [Fucking webmaster](https://justinjackson.ca/webmaster/)
- [Machines of Loving Grace by Reagan Bird](https://www.clunyjournal.com/p/machines-of-loving-grace) - The utter evisceration of one of my core beliefs through empathetic story-telling
- [Programming is forgetting](http://opentranscripts.org/transcript/programming-forgetting-new-hacker-ethic/) A really amazing critique/rethinking of hacker culture

### The value of community
- [Transcender manifesto](https://digital-anthropology.me/2019/03/13/a-transcender-manifesto-for-a-world-beyond-capitalism-a-seed/)
- [The sky is falling, we've got this](https://margaretkilljoy.substack.com/p/the-sky-is-falling-weve-got-this)

### The merits of open source
- [Predator drones run linux](https://j3s.sh/thought/drones-run-linux-free-software-isnt-enough.html)
- [The sustainability of the commons](https://ploum.net/2024-07-01-opensource_sustainability.html)
- [How to kill an decentralised network](https://rosia.me:7777/feed/38/entry/1390), a post about how companies purposefully kill off foss software
