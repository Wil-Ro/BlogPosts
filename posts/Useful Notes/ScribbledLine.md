This is my scribbled line, its a collection of things I find interesting or want to remember. Here you can find a good summary of my world views in the writings I find important and things I think are cool.

## Pages
- [Clear Line](ClearLine.html), A more strictly outlined set of views I hold, along with evidence I use to justify them to myself.
- [Quotes](Quotes.html), A list of quotes I like.
