[farmbot](https://farm.bot/) is a cnc machine that does farming stuff for you, couldnt use that in a polytunnel or greenhouse, its bulky and unescessary. I've previously seen a supposedly "infinite build size" 3d printer that uses a print head held in mid air by wire with motors in 4 corners of a room pushing and pulling it around. This felt a bit weird and wobbly for a 3d printer for something like farmbot it would be perfect!! just carrying a nozzle for spraying water and having a water pipe hanging from the ceiling. this seems really doable!!!!!
