[farmbot](https://farm.bot/) is a cnc machine that does farming stuff for you, couldnt use that in a polytunnel or greenhouse, its bulky and unescessary. I've previously seen a supposedly "infinite build size" 3d printer that uses a print head held in mid air by wire with motors in 4 corners of a room pushing and pulling it around. This felt a bit weird and wobbly for a 3d printer for something like farmbot it would be perfect!! just carrying a nozzle for spraying water and having a water pipe hanging from the ceiling. this seems really doable!!!!!

The more I think about this the more possible it feels, the central device would hold a water tank on top of it, that would give it the weight to drive sensors into the ground or interact with things. It could refill from a really simple refill device when it needs to and could hang at that device when its not being used or during storms (imaging a roomba hub style thing).

The only question I have rn is how much tending do crops actually need? This would be really slow at harvesting and sowing so it could only really care for the plants, is that actually needed? How much care is required?? if its just checking in on them every once in a while then this would be completely unescessary/overkill
