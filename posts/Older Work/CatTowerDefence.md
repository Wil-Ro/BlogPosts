# Tower defence game
> This is an older post from my first personal website I created in secondary school, its yet to be re-written for this new website so expect varying degrees of quality

## What it is
A tower defence game, mostly created over the course of 1-2 months to allow myself and a friend to gain a better understanding of python. Players can place cats to attack balls of wool rolling along a path. Cats can
be upgraded with different upgrade paths and can be deleted to allow  for a partial refund. The tower system was designed to be easily expanded and altered along with a rudimentary map file system that allowed users to
add maps of their own design. Although a functional prototype was created, no artist was ever found to allow for a proper art pass or visual redesign so the project never left this first phase.

## What I did
Almost all of the project was a team effort with I and my friend sharing ideas and working on the same code in a pair programming set-up, swapping and working off each others ideas. I proposed alot of the original logic behind the movement
systems, the level select menu and the file structure for custom maps along with alot of the smaller features such as tower placement and selection. These proposals were built off by both myself and my partner as the system
evolved in complexity and scale.
