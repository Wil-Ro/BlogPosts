## Who I am

I'm Rosia Evans, I'm a programmer studying at a small university in Wales but taking a year out to work in industry in farming robotics. In my spare time I'm teaching myself to create robots and exploring how we can use them in ways that help our environment.

Most of my interests lie in using robotics and computers in farming, exploring how they could help produce more food in a sustainable manner. I feel that computers and automation really could help produce a green
world where people can easily afford the bare minimum and find themselves comfortable and happy.

My physical work involves:

- Learning how robotics can work in [real world environments](SailBot.html)
- Experimenting with how we can use computers in [environmentally sustainable](Permacomputing.html) ways,
- Teaching myself to create [low-power/high efficiency programs](ThisSite.html) and robotics,
- Learning about ideas behind farming automation and how we can produce more food whilst keeping our methods sustainable, becoming an active member of communities such as [TwistedFields](https://community.twistedfields.com/t/welcome-to-the-twisted-fields-community-forum/7),

I've been programming for most of my life. My main language is C++, but I also have multiple years of experience in C#, Python and Java and some loose experience in Typescript and C.
